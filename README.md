<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, Thanos here!!</h1>
<h3 align="center">I would like to say a few things about me.</h3>
If you are here this can be for 2 reasons

 * Because I have made something interesting or..
 * You need more information about me.

## So let's begin...

### some demographics

I am 34 years old, I live in Athens Greece, I am married for 4 years to a wonderful woman, who supports me in any crazy idea I have in my mind. ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

### now business stuff

I have graduated from TEI of Athens with BSc. as informatics engineer. I work as a professional front-end developer since 2014. Additionally, in my mind, programming is a big puzzle, therefore I like to work on my side projects just for fun. As a result, I gain more experience as well. I enjoy working as part of a team because in my opinion more things can be achieved as a team rather than as individuals. Currently, I am working on vuejs project but to be honest I prefer reactjs.

Before the covid era, I was enjoying traveling around Europe and seeing different cultures.
Also, I am runner, a rookie tennis player and amateur photographer. ðŸ˜Š
